# Website Builder

### Introduction 
Building a website is quite fun but at times it might get
frustrating and take up a lot of time. Instead, an application
which allows us to build a website just by dragging and
dropping elements would be much more efficient and user
friendly than coding each and every part of the website
(Similar to Wix). Also people with no prior knowledge of web
development could also build a website.

## Built from Scratch! :smile:

We have created custom components for different HTML elements:
 * Buttons
 * Textarea
 * Paragraph
 * H tags
 * Navbar. 
 
The user can customize the <b> Font Size, Color, Text, Width and Height </b> they want and immediately see the respective HTML element with the specifications.

## Technologies Used
* npm
* Javascript 
* React
* TailwindCSS
* Netlify

### To-Do :checkered_flag:	
Additionally, we implemented basic elements as drag and droppable, but ran out of time and found errors to implement them for custom elements we used on our website.
This project is definitely scalable, and given more time we could've definitely implemented drag and drop feature, along with some more style features and HTML elements.
We tried working with the following packages: 

* React DnD
* React Draggable
* React useDrop Hook
